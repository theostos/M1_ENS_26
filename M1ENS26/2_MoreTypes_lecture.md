# More on Types

So far, we've seen how to *work* with types, and we want to give a somewhat more robust account of their theory.


## The hierarchy
We've seen that propositions are all types of a certain kind `Prop`; and that `ℕ` or `ℝ` are types of a different kind (indeed, both have more than one term!), called `Type`.

There is actually a whole hierarchy of kinds of types

    Prop : Type 0 : Type 1 : ... : Type n : ...

So, `Prop` is a *term* of the *type* `Type 0`, itself a *term* of the type `Type 1`, etc.

Lean shortens `Type 0` to `Type`, omitting the index. It is where most known mathematical objects (like `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℂ`, etc) live. `Sort *` is either `Type (*+1)` or `Prop` in the sense that `Sort 0 = Prop`, `Sort 1 = Type 0`, `Sort 37 = Type 36`...

## Dependent types

The type theory that Lean is built upon axiomatises the existence of certain constructions.

+++ Function types
Given two types `X` and `Y`, it exists the type `X → Y`. Its terms are written
```
λ (x : X) ↦ (f x) : Y
```
or
```
fun (x : X) ↦ f x : Y
```
These terms can be interpreted as functions from `X` to `Y`, in the sense that if `x₀ : X` and `f : X → Y` then `f x` is a term in `Y`.

+++ Π-types and Σ-types


What is the type of
```
fun (α : Type) ↦ (fun x : α ↦ x)
```
namely the assignment sending a type to its identity function?

The "problem" is that for every element in the domain, the image lies in a different place: there is no "codomain".

It belongs to the Π-type (called pi-type, or forall-type, or *dependent* product)
```
Π (α : Type), α → α
∀ (α : Type), α → α
(α : Type) → (α → α)
```

More generally, given a type `A` (where `A = Sort u` is allowed) and an function `I : A → Sort v`, seen as an "indexing family", a term in
```
Π (a : A), I a
∀ (a : A), I a
(a : A) → I a
```
is the type whose terms are collections `(a, xₐ)` for `a` spanning `A` and where `xₐ : I a`. These are written `λ a : A ↦ xₐ`, or `fun a : A ↦ xₐ`.

* If you've got a geometric intuition, this looks very much like a fibration, where `A` is the base and `I a` is the fiber above `a : A`.

* As the `λ` or `fun` notation suggest, `X → Y` is a special case of a Π-type, where `I : X → Sort v` is the constant function `fun x ↦ I x = Y`.

Similarly, terms of the Σ-type
```
Σ (a : A), I a
(a : A) × I a
```
are pairs `⟨a, xₐ⟩` where `xₐ : I a` (for technical reasons, we need here that `A : Type u` and  that `I : A → Type v`: if you really want to use `Sort` use Σ', or ×').

* These constructions of types that depend on terms give the name "dependent type theory" (or "dependent λ-calculus") to the underlying theory.

* From the hierarchy point of view, if `A : Sort u` and `I : A → Sort v`, then `(a : A) → I a` and `(a : A) ×' I a` are types in `max u v` *except* when `v = 0` in which case both are still in `Prop`. This is the "impredicativity" of the underlying type-theory.

+++ ∀ and ∃
#### Universal quantifier

Consider the statement
> For every `n : ℕ` there exists a prime `p` such that `n < p`.

Or
```math
∀\; n ∈ ℕ, ∃\; p\, \text{ prime such that } n < p
```
It is a Π-type, with `I : ℕ → Prop` being `I := fun n ↦ ∃ p prime, n < p`.

Euclid's proof is a *term* of the above type.

* You can *prove* a ∀ `intro`ducing a variable (thought of as a "generic element", do `intro x` to call this element `x`), and by proving `P x`.
* If you have `H : ∀ x : α, P x` and also a term `y : α`, you can specialise `H` to `y`:

        specialize H y (:= P y)

* If the goal is `⊢ P y`, you might simply want to do `exact H y`, remembering that implications, `∀` and functions are all the same thing.


#### Existential quantifier
Similarly, consider the statement
> There exists `n : ℕ` such that `n ^ 2 + 37 * n < e ^ n`

or
```math
∃\; n ∈ ℕ, n^2+37 · n < 2 ^ n.
```
This is a Σ-type `(n : ℕ) × I n`, where `I := λ n ↦ (n ^ 2 + 37 * n < e ^ n) : Prop`: a term in it would be a pair `⟨n, hₙ⟩` where `n : ℕ` and `hₙ` is a proof that `n ^ 2 + 37 * n < e ^ n`.

Once more,
* To prove `∃ x, P x`, you first produce `x`, and then prove it satisfies `P x`: once you have constructed `x`, do `use x` to have Lean ask you for `⊢ P x`.
* If you have `H : ∃ x, P x`, do `obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := H` to obtain the term `x` together with a proof that `P x`.

+++ `¬` and Proofs by contradiction
* Given `P : Prop`, the *definition* of `¬ P` is

    P → `False`

* The `exfalso` tactic changes *any* goal to proving `False` (useful if you have an *assumption* ` ... → False`).

* Proofs by contradiction, introduced using the `by_contra` tactic, require you to prove `False` assuming `not (the goal)`: if your goal is `⊢ P`, typing `by_contra h` creates

    | h : ¬ P
      ⊢ False

* The difference between `exfalso` and `by_contra` is that the first does not introduce anything, and forgets the actual goal; the second negates the goal and asks for `False`.

## Inductive Types

So far, we
* met some abstract types `α, β, T : Type`, and variations like `α → T` or `β → Type`;
* also met a lot of types `P, Q, (1 = 2) ∧ (0 ≤ 5) : Prop`;
* struggled a bit with `h : (2 = 3)` *versus* `(2 = 3) : Prop`;
* also met `ℕ`, `ℝ`...

How can we *construct* new types, or how have these been constructed? For instance, `ℝ`, or `True : Prop` or the set of even numbers? Using **inductive types**.

+++ Perspectives

* *Theoretical*: this is (fun & interesting, but) beyond the scope of this course: it is very much discussed in the references.
* *Practical*: think of `ℕ` and surf the wave. It has two **constructors**: the constant `0 : ℕ` and the function `succ : ℕ → ℕ`, and every `n : ℕ` is of either form. Moreover, it satisfies **induction**/recursion.

For example
```lean
inductive NiceType
  | Tom : NiceType
  | Jerry : NiceType
  | f : NiceType → NiceType
  | g : ℕ → NiceType → NiceType → NiceType
```
constructs the "minimal/smallest" type `NiceType` whose terms are
1. Either `Tom`;
1. Or `Jerry`;
1. Or an application of `f` to some previously-defined term;
1. Or an application of `g` to a natural and a pair of previously-defined terms.

For example, `f (g 37 Tom Tom) : NiceType`.

Every inductive type comes with its *recursor*, that is automatically constructed by Lean: it builds dependent functions *out of the inductive type being constructed* by declaring the value that should be assigned to every constructor.

In order to
1. construct terms of type `NiceType` you can use the ... *constructors*!;
1. access terms of type `NiceType` (in a proof, say), use the tactic `cases` (or or `rcases`):  the proofs for Tom and for Jerry might differ, so a case-splitting is natural.

> **Every type in Lean is an inductive type**

By *every* we mean `True`, `False`, `Bool`, `P ∧ Q`... every! And among those,

#### If and only if statements:
`↔ : Prop → Prop → Prop`: it is an inductive type (of course), with
* two parameters (`P` and `Q`)
* one constructor, itself made of
    * two fields: `Iff.mp : P → Q` and `Iff.mpr : Q → P`

```
structure Iff (a b : Prop) : Prop
    number of parameters: 2
    fields:
        Iff.mp : a → b
        Iff.mpr : b → a
    constructor: Iff.intro {a b : Prop} (mp : a → b) (mpr : b → a) : a ↔ b
```

An equivalence can be either *proved* or *used*. This amounts to saying that

* A goal `⊢ P ↔ Q` can be broken into the goals `⊢ P → Q` and `⊢ Q → P` using `constructor`: indeed, to prove `⊢ P ↔ Q` amounts to creating *the unique term* of `P ↔ Q` which has two constructors;
* The projections `(P ↔ Q).1` (or `(P ↔ Q).mp`) and `(P ↔ Q).2` (or `(P ↔ Q).mpr`) are the implications `P → Q` and `Q → P`, respectively. These are the two "components" of the term in `P ↔ Q`.

### Structures
Among inductive types (*i. e.* all types...), some are remarkably useful for formalising mathematical objects: *structures*. Typically, they are used to *bundle* objects and properties together.

As an example, let's see what a Monoid is:
```
structure (α : Type*) Monoid where
...
...
```

> **Definition**
>> A structure is an inductive type with a unique constructor.

* We've already encountered some structures: both `∧` and `↔` are structures, whereas... why is
a structure all constructors of which are `Prop`-valued, itself in `Prop`?
